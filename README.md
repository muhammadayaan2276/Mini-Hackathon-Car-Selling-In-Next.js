A professional footer and navbar that feature the PakWheels logo, giving the website a polished and branded appearance.
Hero Section:

An engaging hero section designed to grab the user's attention upon visiting the website.
Featured Cars Section:

This section displays images of cars along with brief details.
Each car links to a dedicated Details Page.
The headings in the Featured Cars Section are static.
Details Page for Each Car:

Each car has a detailed description page where users can view its specifications and features.
A Make Payment button is available, which redirects users to the form page.
Form Page for Placing Orders:

Users can fill in their details on the form to place an order.
After submitting the form, a "Thank You for Shopping" message is displayed, indicating that the order is being processed.
Users are informed that the order will arrive within 2â€“3 days.
Static Headings in Navbar and Featured Cars Section:

All other headings in the Navbar and Featured Cars Section are static.
